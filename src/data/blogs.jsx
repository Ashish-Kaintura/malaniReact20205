        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Imported marble has long been the top choice of architects, builders, and retailers when creating high-end spaces. No luxury interior is complete without marble! Marble is a durable, elegant, timeless material that gives character and presence to residential, commercial, and retail projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          For interior designers and builders in Delhi and Pan India, the choices for imported marble can feel overwhelming due to the many types of marble, finishes, and price points available. With dedication and many years of experience, <strong>Malani Marbles Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, a reliable supplier of high-quality premium marble, shares best practices to effectively choose imported marble for your high-end interior projects.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Understanding Different Types of Imported Marble</h2>
        <p>
          When picking the best marble, the first step is to be aware of the types of marble available. The imported marble variety comes in many textures, colors, and patterns that have their own aesthetic (visual) or functional properties.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Italian Marble</h3>
        <p>
          When you think of marble, Italian marble comes to mind. Italian marble is synonymous with luxury. This type of marble is recognized for its beautiful veining and polished finish. We see Italian marble in upscale flooring, wall features, and countertops. Particularly, <em>Calacatta</em>, <em>Carrara</em>, and <em>Statuario</em> marble are popular examples where their distinct elegance adds to the environment.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Onyx Marble</h3>
        <p>
          In the category of semi-precious stones, onyx is a unique stone, prized for its translucency and patterns. Onyx is perfect for feature walls, backlit installations, and luxury reception areas. It adds a special sophistication to all interior spaces.
        </p>
        <p className="italic">
          Note to Builders/Architects: Please note that onyx is a delicate material that requires care in handling and installation.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Other Imported Varieties</h3>
        <p>
          Along with Italian marble and onyx, Turkish, Spanish, and Carrara marble varieties are the other common options with imports. These types of marbles are often selected for their naturally vibrant color, unique vein patterns, and durability.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">How to Choose Imported Marble for Your Project</h2>
        <p>
          Selecting marble is not just based on appearance but also on durability, finish, and type of project.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Determine the Type of Project</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Residential:</strong> Whites, grays, and beiges are all marbles that provide an elegant neutral foundation for living rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms.</li>
          <li><strong>Commercial Spaces:</strong> Some marbles should be specified for greater durability and better resistance to staining and use in high-traffic voids such as lobbies and showrooms.</li>
          <li><strong>Retail Shops and Showrooms:</strong> Marble flooring establishes a level of luxury and an impression for customers all at the same time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Evaluate Finish and Texture</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Polished Marble:</strong> Provides a glossy and reflective surface; best for luxury interiors but may require maintenance.</li>
          <li><strong>Honed Marble:</strong> Offers a matte finish, suitable for floors that see heavy foot traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>Textured Marble:</strong> Adds character for feature walls and decorative elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Pricing and Quality Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          Imported marble comes at varying price points depending on origin, rarity, and finish.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Italian and Turkish marble tend to be more expensive due to quality and import costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Type & Pattern:</strong> Unique veining and semi-precious stones increase pricing.</li>
          <li><strong>Thickness & Finish:</strong> Thicker slabs and polished finishes cost more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="italic">
          Tip: For architects and builders, balancing cost and aesthetics ensures a project stays within budget while maintaining luxury standards.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Comparing Imported Marble with Indian Marble</h2>
        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Imported Marble Advantages:</h3>

          <li>Higher luxury appeal for premium interiors</li>
          <li>Suitable for high-end residential and commercial projects</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Indian Marble Advantages:</h3>

          <li>Cost-effective for large projects</li>
          <li>Readily available with lower shipping and logistics concerns</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="italic">
          Pro Tip: Combining imported marble as feature elements with Indian marble for flooring or secondary spaces can optimize both budget and aesthetics.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Design Tips for Luxury Interiors</h2>

        <p>
          For all its glory, Italian marble is one of the few materials that
          conveys both eternal aesthetics and architectural genius when
          thinking about luxury interior marble design. For hundreds of years,
          Italian marble has been synonymous with sophistication, elegance, and
          incomparable quality, and it has been used as decoration in some of
          the world’s most celebrated buildings. It is now 2025, and Italian
          marble is still—and for good reason—the preferred choice for several
          architects and interior designers for commercial and residential
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even today, at <strong>Malani Marbles Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, we
          experience Italian marble as a leading influence on modern-day
          architecture and interior aesthetics across all of India. Italian
          marble is used in flooring, wall cladding, and countertops; it is not
          only a natural stone but also an art form and a statement of
          extravagance.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">
        The Legacy of Italian Marble
        </h2>
        <p>
          The history of Italian marble dates back to ancient Rome and ancient
          Greece, when marble was utilized for sculptures, monuments, and
          castles that can still be visited today. Stones like Carrara,
          Statuario, and Calacatta gained prominence as people began marveling
          at their exquisite veining, bright whiteness, and fine polish. In
          2025, that same aesthetic quality continues today. Architects have
          always appreciated Italian marble and continue to appreciate it today
          because it combines classic tradition and modernity for an aesthetic
          that will never go out of style.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">
           Why Architects Prefer Italian Marble Over Other Options
        </h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          1. Unmatched Elegance and Aesthetics
        </h3>
        <p>
          Most architects consider Italian marble's aesthetic value to be the
          main reason for choosing the material. Each slab is a unique piece of
          art with natural veining patterns that create depth and dimension. No
          matter if the stone is used for flooring, a grand lobby, or a polished
          island in the kitchen, it instantaneously gives a space
          sophistication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike alternative materials, Italian marble works to reflect light
          beautifully and provides an interior with substantial illumination and
          an airy character. This characteristic is a design consideration of
          modern architects in 2025.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          2. Durability and Long-Term Value
        </h3>
        <p>
          Although it is known for its beautiful appearance, Italian marble is
          also quite durable. Installed correctly and maintained properly, it
          could last for decades without losing its luster. Architects not only
          recommend it based on aesthetics but also as a long-term investment as
          well; it is often the case that a project with Italian marble flooring
          or wall panels appreciates. This undeniably makes it attractive to
          high-end property buyers.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          3. Versatility in Design Applications
        </h3>
        <p>
          Whether it's a classic villa or a super-modern apartment, Italian
          marble is suitable for every design idea. It is adaptable and works
          well for:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Living room and foyer flooring</li>
          <li>Bathroom vanities and countertops</li>
          <li>Wall cladding and feature walls</li>
          <li>Columns and staircases</li>
          <li>Kitchen backsplash</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Popular selections such as Statuario, Botticino, Calacatta Gold, and
          Carrara White deliver a spectrum of colors and vein patterns and allow
          architects to achieve a unified look while enhancing a lively visual
          journey through the project.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          4. Symbol of Luxury and Prestige
        </h3>
        <p>
          Italian marble has become a symbol of prestige in architecture and
          design in India. Developers and homeowners associate it with
          sophistication, class, and luxury. A number of high-end builders
          specify imported marble from Italy as part of the luxurious offerings.
          Italian marble is more than a material; it's a brand symbol that
          contributes, hopefully, towards elevating the value of the property.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          5. Sustainability and Responsible Sourcing
        </h3>
        <p>
          As sustainability began to become mainstream in 2025, marble suppliers
          in Italy revised their quarrying within the standards to reduce their
          environmental impact. <strong>Malani Marbles Pvt. Ltd.</strong> imports
          from Italian marble quarries with the appropriate certifications and
          policies. Thus, designers can specify our products confidently, knowing
          they are compliant with international environmental policies and
          production standards relevant to quality.
        </p>

        Onyx Marble: The Gemstone of Luxury Interiors
      </h1>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Introduction</h2>
      <p>

Onyx marble, distinguished by its translucent glow, dramatic veining, and color revelations, has become the asset of luxury interiors around the globe. Architects, designers, and homeowners attracted to luxury well beyond conventional marble select onyx for its unmatched beauty and luminescent quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Malani Marbles Pvt. Ltd., we present you the best quality onyx imported into India from world-class quarries in Italy, Turkey, Iran, and Mexico. Our premium imported offerings will convert any living area, whether it's a luxury villa, hotel lobby, or stunning wall or floor, into a statement onyx marble masterpiece.

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">What Is Onyx Marble?</h2>
      <p>
        Onyx marble is a semi-precious stone that is created from deposition layers of calcite that give it a natural translucency and color bands that flow freely. Unlike regular marble, onyx glows when backlit, enriching the environment with a mystical glow. Each slab is a natural canvas, and no two pieces are alike, making it ideal for clients who desire that personal touch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Onyx marble is known for its individuality in soft white and honey tones to deeper green, pink, and multi-colored patterns, and it receives the nickname "the gemstone of luxury interiors" due to its stone-like quality. Designers utilize it as an accent wall, counters, bathroom vanities, or decorative panels to create a memorable visual influence.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Onyx Marble Price in India</h2>
      <p>
        When you want to invest in elegance, you should pay attention to the onyx marble price. The prices vary depending on color, pattern, and transparency, as well as where the marble originated. In general, the onyx marble price in India will begin around ₹500 per sq. ft., and supplementary pricing will exceed ₹3,000 per sq. ft. depending on the variation of the onyx and its rarity, largely due to the high level of translucency.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Understanding factors affecting onyx marble prices:</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Color & Rarity: Exotic color shades such as blue or multi-colored onyx would be priced higher.</li>
        <li>Origin: Imported onyx in India from overseas countries, such as Italy, Turkey, or Iran, is pricier. This is due to quality and purity.</li>
        <li>Transparency: Generally speaking, luxury equates to translucency.</li>
        <li>Finishing & Thickness: Any type of book-matched or polished slab requires higher levels of processing, which will modestly affect pricing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Luxury Onyx Flooring—A Statement of Sophistication</h2>
      <p>
        Luxury onyx floors have striking visual appeal. The translucent surface and vibrant color bands refract light to create an illusion of a sense of "depth" and "dimension" rarely found in a natural stone. When backlit, the onyx flooring glows softly to enhance the energy and mood of the space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luxury onyx flooring is ideal for the lobby, spas, luxury bathrooms, and dining rooms; it helps redefine the border between art and architecture. Designers adore it and frequently incorporate it into custom design projects that prioritize exclusivity and elegance. More than just beauty, onyx flooring can be sealed and offers durability and low maintenance, all with lasting qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
        We stock Malani Marbles Pvt. Ltd. selections in many finishes: polished, honed, book-matched, and more for you to design and decorate interiors with sophistication and refined taste and designs.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Exploring Colored Onyx Designs</h2>
      <p>
        The range of colored onyx designs is as diverse as nature itself. Each slab tells a story through its organic patterns, such as pastel-colored waves of color and bold punctuated streaks. Whether the design is in a modern penthouse or a classic palace, the use of colored onyx will always capture your attention.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Green Onyx with white veining, which is peaceful and luxurious;</li>
        <li>Honey Onyx with amber tones, which is rich and welcoming;</li>
        <li>Blue Onyx, which is quite rare, yet a cool color suitable for contemporary designs;</li>
        <li>Multicolor Onyx, which is artistic and would make a strong statement in any wall design.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Design professionals use onyx slabs for accent walls, reception counters, and backlit ceilings. The translucence of the stone makes it conducive to lighting concepts that give the interior a dynamic and ever-changing presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Malani Marbles Pvt. Ltd. uses both craftsmanship and design experience to help its clients turn colored onyx designs into their own masterpieces.
