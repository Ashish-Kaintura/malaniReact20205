        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Understanding Different Types of Imported Marble</h2>
        <p>
          When picking the best marble, the first step is to be aware of the types of marble available. The imported marble variety comes in many textures, colors, and patterns that have their own aesthetic (visual) or functional properties.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Italian Marble</h3>
        <p>
          When you think of marble, Italian marble comes to mind. Italian marble is synonymous with luxury. This type of marble is recognized for its beautiful veining and polished finish. We see Italian marble in upscale flooring, wall features, and countertops. Particularly, <em>Calacatta</em>, <em>Carrara</em>, and <em>Statuario</em> marble are popular examples where their distinct elegance adds to the environment.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Onyx Marble</h3>
        <p>
          In the category of semi-precious stones, onyx is a unique stone, prized for its translucency and patterns. Onyx is perfect for feature walls, backlit installations, and luxury reception areas. It adds a special sophistication to all interior spaces.
        </p>
        <p className="italic">
          Note to Builders/Architects: Please note that onyx is a delicate material that requires care in handling and installation.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Other Imported Varieties</h3>
        <p>
          Along with Italian marble and onyx, Turkish, Spanish, and Carrara marble varieties are the other common options with imports. These types of marbles are often selected for their naturally vibrant color, unique vein patterns, and durability.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">How to Choose Imported Marble for Your Project</h2>
        <p>
          Selecting marble is not just based on appearance but also on durability, finish, and type of project.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Determine the Type of Project</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Residential:</strong> Whites, grays, and beiges are all marbles that provide an elegant neutral foundation for living rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms.</li>
          <li><strong>Commercial Spaces:</strong> Some marbles should be specified for greater durability and better resistance to staining and use in high-traffic voids such as lobbies and showrooms.</li>
          <li><strong>Retail Shops and Showrooms:</strong> Marble flooring establishes a level of luxury and an impression for customers all at the same time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Evaluate Finish and Texture</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Polished Marble:</strong> Provides a glossy and reflective surface; best for luxury interiors but may require maintenance.</li>
          <li><strong>Honed Marble:</strong> Offers a matte finish, suitable for floors that see heavy foot traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>Textured Marble:</strong> Adds character for feature walls and decorative elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Pricing and Quality Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          Imported marble comes at varying price points depending on origin, rarity, and finish.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Italian and Turkish marble tend to be more expensive due to quality and import costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Type & Pattern:</strong> Unique veining and semi-precious stones increase pricing.</li>
          <li><strong>Thickness & Finish:</strong> Thicker slabs and polished finishes cost more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="italic">
          Tip: For architects and builders, balancing cost and aesthetics ensures a project stays within budget while maintaining luxury standards.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Comparing Imported Marble with Indian Marble</h2>
